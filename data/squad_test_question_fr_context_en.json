Adults of various species range from a few millimeters to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) in size. Like cnidarians, their bodies consist of a mass of jelly, with one layer of cells on the outside and another lining the internal cavity. In ctenophores, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only one cell deep. Some authors combined ctenophores and cnidarians in one phylum, Coelenterata, as both groups rely on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration.

The pharma (as it was referred to) often operated through a retail shop which, in addition to ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and patent medicines. Often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as the dominant term, though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy, in English the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only approproriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent.

The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The combined wealth of the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900. A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined.

It has also allowed for the rapid spread of technologies and ideas. The term imperialism has been applied to Western (and Japanese) political and economic dominance especially in Asia and Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries. Its precise meaning continues to be debated by scholars. Some writers, such as Edward Said, use the term more broadly to describe any system of domination and subordination organised with an imperial center and a periphery.", "qas": [{"id": "573060b48ab72b1400f9c4c6", "question": "Le mot imp\u00e9rialisme a ses origines dans quelle langue ancienne ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 74, "text": "Latin"}, {"answer_start": 74, "text": "Latin"}, {"answer_start": 74, "text": "Latin"}, {"answer_start": 74, "text": "Latin"}, {"answer_start": 74, "text": "Latin"}]}, {"id": "573060b48ab72b1400f9c4c7", "question": "Par quels moyens l'imp\u00e9rialisme \u00e9tend-il le pouvoir et l'influence d'un pays ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 240, "text": "military force"}, {"answer_start": 219, "text": "colonization, use of military force, or other means"}, {"answer_start": 219, "text": "colonization, use of military force, or other means"}, {"answer_start": 219, "text": "colonization, use of military force, or other"}, {"answer_start": 219, "text": "colonization"}]}, {"id": "573060b48ab72b1400f9c4c9", "question": "A quel imp\u00e9rialisme de pays de l'Est s'est appliqu\u00e9 ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 450, "text": "Japan"}, {"answer_start": 450, "text": "Japan"}, {"answer_start": 450, "text": "Japanese"}, {"answer_start": 450, "text": "Japanese"}, {"answer_start": 450, "text": "Japan"}]}, {"id": "573060b48ab72b1400f9c4ca", "question": "Quel imp\u00e9rialisme s'est r\u00e9pandu ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 372, "text": "technologies and ideas"}, {"answer_start": 372, "text": "technologies and ideas"}, {"answer_start": 372, "text": "technologies and ideas"}, {"answer_start": 372, "text": "technologies and ideas"}, {"answer_start": 372, "text": "technologies and ideas."}]}]}]}, {"title": "United_Methodist_Church", "paragraphs": [{"context": "The United Methodist Church (UMC) is a mainline Protestant Methodist denomination.

A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years. By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia.", "qas": [{"id": "573735e8c3c5551400e51e71", "question": "Quel concept les philosophes de l'Antiquit\u00e9 utilisaient-ils pour \u00e9tudier les machines simples ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 46, "text": "force"}, {"answer_start": 46, "text": "force"}, {"answer_start": 31, "text": "the concept of force"}, {"answer_start": 31, "text": "the concept of force"}, {"answer_start": 46, "text": "force"}, {"answer_start": 46, "text": "force"}]}, {"id": "573735e8c3c5551400e51e72", "question": "Quelle \u00e9tait la croyance que le maintien du mouvement exigeait de la force ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 387, "text": "fundamental error"}, {"answer_start": 385, "text": "A fundamental error"}, {"answer_start": 385, "text": "A fundamental error"}, {"answer_start": 385, "text": "A fundamental error"}, {"answer_start": 385, "text": "A fundamental error"}, {"answer_start": 385, "text": "A fundamental error"}]}, {"id": "573735e8c3c5551400e51e73", "question": "Qui a eu un aper\u00e7u math\u00e9matique?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 654, "text": "Sir Isaac Newton"}, {"answer_start": 654, "text": "Sir Isaac Newton"}, {"answer_start": 654, "text": "Sir Isaac Newton"}, {"answer_start": 654, "text": "Sir Isaac Newton"}, {"answer_start": 654, "text": "Sir Isaac Newton"}, {"answer_start": 654, "text": "Sir Isaac Newton"}]}, {"id": "573735e8c3c5551400e51e74", "question": "Combien de temps a-t-il fallu pour am\u00e9liorer les lois du mouvement de Sir Isaac Newton ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 727, "text": "nearly three hundred years"}, {"answer_start": 727, "text": "nearly three hundred years"}, {"answer_start": 727, "text": "nearly three hundred years"}, {"answer_start": 727, "text": "nearly three hundred years"}, {"answer_start": 727, "text": "nearly three hundred years"}, {"answer_start": 734, "text": "three hundred years"}]}, {"id": "573735e8c3c5551400e51e75", "question": "Qui a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 la th\u00e9orie de la relativit\u00e9?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 782, "text": "Einstein"}, {"answer_start": 782, "text": "Einstein"}, {"answer_start": 782, "text": "Einstein"}, {"answer_start": 782, "text": "Einstein"}, {"answer_start": 782, "text": "Einstein"}, {"answer_start": 782, "text": "Einstein"}]}]}]}], "version": "1.1"}
