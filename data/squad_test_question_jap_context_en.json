This basin encompasses 7,000,000 square kilometres (2,700,000 sq mi), of which 5,500,000 square kilometres (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations. The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60% of the rainforest, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. States or departments in four nations contain \"Amazonas\" in their names. The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining rainforests, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species.", "qas": [{"id": "5725b81b271a42140099d097", "question":

In ctenophores, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only one cell deep.

The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The combined wealth of the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900. A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined. Oxfam's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net wealth (adding up assets and subtracting debts), the Oxfam report, for instance, finds that there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China (due to a greater tendency to take on debts).[unreliable source?][unreliable source?] Anthony Shorrocks, the lead author of the Credit Suisse report which is one of the sources of Oxfam's data, considers the criticism about debt to be a \"silly argument\" and \"a non-issue . . . a diversion.\"", "qas": [{"id":

The uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization, e.g., 3, 1 \u00b7 3, 1 \u00b7 1 \u00b7 3, etc. are all valid factorizations of 3.", "qas": [{"id": "57296d571d04691400779413", "question": "\u7d20\u6570\u306e1\u4ee5\u5916\u306e\u9664\u6570\u306f\u4f55\u304b\uff1f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 110, "text": "itself"}, {"answer_start": 110, "text": "itself"}, {"answer_start": 110, "text": "itself"}, {"answer_start": 110, "text": "itself"}, {"answer_start": 110, "text": "itself"}]}, {"id": "57296d571d04691400779414", "question": "\u7d20\u6570\u3067\u306a\u30441\u3088\u308a\u5927\u304d\u3044\u81ea\u7136\u6570\u306f\u4f55\u3068\u547c\u3070\u308c\u308b\u304b\uff1f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 189, "text": "composite number"}, {"answer_start": 189, "text": "composite number"}, {"answer_start": 189, "text": "composite number"}, {"answer_start": 439, "text": "primes"}]}, {"id": "57296d571d04691400779415", "question": "\u6570\u8ad6\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u7d20\u6570\u306e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5f79\u5272\u3092\u78ba\u7acb\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306f\u4f55\u306e\u5b9a\u7406\u304b\uff1f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 369, "text": "The fundamental theorem of arithmetic"}, {"answer_start": 373, "text": "fundamental theorem of arithmetic"}, {"answer_start": 396, "text": "arithmetic"}, {"answer_start": 373, "text": "fundamental theorem of arithmetic"}, {"answer_start": 373, "text": "fundamental theorem of arithmetic"}]}, {"id": "57296d571d04691400779416", "question": "1\u3088\u308a\u5927\u304d\u3044\u4efb\u610f\u306e\u6574\u6570\u306f\u4f55\u3068\u3057\u3066\u8868\u3059\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u304b\uff1f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 511, "text": "a product of primes"}, {"answer_start": 513, "text": "product of primes that is unique up to ordering"}, {"answer_start": 524, "text": "primes"}, {"answer_start": 524, "text": "primes"}, {"answer_start": 524, "text": "primes that is unique up to ordering"}]}, {"id": "57296d571d04691400779417", "question": "\u306a\u305c1\u3092\u7d20\u6570\u3068\u3057\u3066\u9664\u5916\u3059\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 625, "text": "because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization"}, {"answer_start": 633, "text": "one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization"}, {"answer_start": 637, "text": "can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization"}, {"answer_start": 633, "text": "one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization"}, {"answer_start": 625, "text": "because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization"}]}]}]}, {"title": "Rhine", "paragraphs": [{"context": "The Rhine (Romansh: Rein, German: Rhein, French: le Rhin, Dutch: Rijn) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graub\u00fcnden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein border, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands.

It embraces both liturgical and evangelical elements.", "qas": [{"id": "5730982f396df919000961e2", "question": "UMC\u306f\u4f55\u3092\u8868\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304b\uff1f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 4, "text": "United Methodist Church"}, {"answer_start": 4, "text": "United Methodist Church (UMC)"}, {"answer_start": 4, "text": "United Methodist Church"}]}, {"id": "5730982f396df919000961e3", "question": "\u5408\u540c\u30e1\u30bd\u30b8\u30b9\u30c8\u6559\u4f1a\u3068\u306f\u4f55\u304b\uff1f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 39, "text": "mainline Protestant Methodist denomination"}, {"answer_start": 34, "text": "is a mainline Protestant Methodist denomination"}, {"answer_start": 37, "text": "a mainline Protestant Methodist denomination"}]}, {"id": "5730982f396df919000961e4", "question": "\u5408\u540c\u30e1\u30bd\u30b8\u30b9\u30c8\u6559\u4f1a\u306f\u3044\u3064\u8a2d\u7acb\u3055\u308c\u305f\u304b\uff1f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 167, "text": "1968"}, {"answer_start": 39, "text": "mainline Protestant Methodist denomination"}, {"answer_start": 167, "text": "1968"}]}, {"id": "5730982f396df919000961e5", "question": "\u8ab0\u304cUMC\u3092\u8a2d\u7acb\u3057\u305f\u304b\uff1f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 179, "text": "union of the Methodist Church (USA) and the Evangelical United Brethren Church"}, {"answer_start": 316, "text": "John and Charles Wesley in England"}, {"answer_start": 175, "text": "the union of the Methodist Church (USA) and the Evangelical United Brethren Church"}]}, {"id": "5730982f396df919000961e6", "question": "\u305d\u306e\u5354\u4f1a\u306e\u795e\u5b66\u7684\u306a\u8d77\u6e90\u306f\u4f55\u306b\u3042\u308b\u304b\uff1f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 463, "text": "Wesleyan"}, {"answer_start": 438, "text": "orientation is decidedly Wesleyan"}, {"answer_start": 463, "text": "Wesleyan"}]}]}]}, {"title": "French_and_Indian_War", "paragraphs": [{"context": "The French and Indian War (1754\u20131763) was the North American theater of the worldwide Seven Years' War.

In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years. By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia.", "qas": [{"id": "573735e8c3c5551400e51e71", "question": "\u53e4\u4ee3\u306e\u54f2\u5b66\u8005\u304c\u5358\u7d14\u306a\u6a5f\u68b0\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u7528\u3044\u305f\u306e\u306f\u4f55\u306e\u6982\u5ff5\u304b\uff1f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 46, "text": "force"}, {"answer_start": 46, "text": "force"}, {"answer_start": 31, "text": "the concept of force"}, {"answer_start": 31, "text": "the concept of force"}, {"answer_start": 46, "text": "force"}, {"answer_start": 46, "text": "force"}]}, {"id": "573735e8c3c5551400e51e72", "question": "\u529b\u3068\u306f\u4e00\u5b9a\u901f\u5ea6\u306e\u52d5\u306b\u3088\u308a\u4fdd\u6301\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u4fe1\u5ff5\u306f\u4f55\u3067\u3042\u3063\u305f\u304b\uff1f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 387, "text": "fundamental error"}, {"answer_start": 385, "text": "A fundamental error"}, {"answer_start": 385, "text": "A fundamental error"}, {"answer_start": 385, "text": "A fundamental error"}, {"answer_start": 385, "text": "A fundamental error"}, {"answer_start": 385, "text": "A fundamental error"}]}, {"id": "573735e8c3c5551400e51e73", "question": "\u6570\u5b66\u7684\u306a\u8996\u70b9\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u3044\u3066\u904b\u52d5\u6cd5\u5247\u3092\u5b9a\u5f0f\u5316\u3057\u305f\u306e\u306f\u8ab0\u304b\uff1f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 654, "text": "Sir Isaac Newton"}, {"answer_start": 654, "text": "Sir Isaac Newton"}, {"answer_start": 654, "text": "Sir Isaac Newton"}, {"answer_start": 654, "text": "Sir Isaac Newton"}, {"answer_start": 654, "text": "Sir Isaac Newton"}, {"answer_start": 654, "text": "Sir Isaac Newton"}]}, {"id": "573735e8c3c5551400e51e74", "question": "\u3069\u308c\u304f\u3089\u3044\u306e\u671f\u9593\u3001Sir Isaac Newton\u306e\u904b\u52d5\u6cd5\u5247\u306f\u6539\u826f\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u304b\uff1f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 727, "text": "nearly three hundred years"}, {"answer_start": 727, "text": "nearly three hundred years"}, {"answer_start": 727, "text": "nearly three hundred years"}, {"answer_start": 727, "text": "nearly three hundred years"}, {"answer_start": 727, "text": "nearly three hundred years"}, {"answer_start": 734, "text": "three hundred years"}]}, {"id": "573735e8c3c5551400e51e75", "question": "\u76f8\u5bfe\u6027\u7406\u8ad6\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3057\u305f\u306e\u306f\u8ab0\u304b\uff1f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 782, "text": "Einstein"}, {"answer_start": 782, "text": "Einstein"}, {"answer_start": 782, "text": "Einstein"}, {"answer_start": 782, "text": "Einstein"}, {"answer_start": 782, "text": "Einstein"}, {"answer_start": 782, "text": "Einstein"}]}]}]}], "version": "1.1"}
