The rock cycle is an important concept in geology which illustrates the relationships between these three types of rock, and magma. When a rock crystallizes from melt (magma and/or lava), it is an igneous rock. This rock can be weathered and eroded, and then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock, or be turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure that change the mineral content of the rock which gives it a characteristic fabric. The sedimentary rock can then be subsequently turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure and is then weathered, eroded, deposited, and lithified, ultimately becoming a sedimentary rock. Sedimentary rock may also be re-eroded and redeposited, and metamorphic rock may also undergo additional metamorphism. All three types of rocks may be re-melted; when this happens, a new magma is formed, from which an igneous rock may once again crystallize.", "qas": [{"id": "572657d9dd62a815002e8230", "question": "An igneous rock is a rock that crystallizes from what?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 238, "text": "melt (magma and/or lava)"}, {"answer_start": 238, "text": "melt"}, {"answer_start": 215, "text": "rock crystallizes from melt (magma and/or lava)"}, {"answer_start": 238, "text": "melt (magma and/or lava)"}]}, {"id": "572657d9dd62a815002e8231", "question": "Sedimentary rock can be turned into which of the three types of rock?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 592, "text": "metamorphic rock"}, {"answer_start": 592, "text": "metamorphic"}, {"answer_start": 592, "text": "metamorphic rock"}, {"answer_start": 592, "text": "metamorphic"}]}, {"id": "572657d9dd62a815002e8232", "question": "When the three types of rock are re-melted what is formed?

The combined wealth of the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people.

At the start of the war, the French North American colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 European settlers, compared with 2 million in the British North American colonies. The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians. Long in conflict, the metropole nations declared war on each other in 1756, escalating the war from a regional affair into an intercontinental conflict.", "qas": [{"id": "5733cf61d058e614000b62e9", "question": "When was the French and Indian War?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 27, "text": "1754\u20131763"}, {"answer_start": 27, "text": "1754\u20131763"}, {"answer_start": 27, "text": "1754\u20131763"}, {"answer_start": 27, "text": "1754\u20131763"}, {"answer_start": 27, "text": "1754\u20131763"}]}, {"id": "5733cf61d058e614000b62ea", "question": "Who fought in the French and Indian war?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 135, "text": "colonies of British America and New France"}, {"answer_start": 135, "text": "colonies of British America and New France"}, {"answer_start": 147, "text": "British America and New France"}, {"answer_start": 147, "text": "British America and New France"}, {"answer_start": 131, "text": "the colonies of British America and New France"}]}, {"id": "5733cf61d058e614000b62eb", "question": "How many people were in French North American Colonies?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 395, "text": "roughly 60,000 European settlers"}, {"answer_start": 403, "text": "60,000"}, {"answer_start": 403, "text": "60,000"}, {"answer_start": 403, "text": "60,000"}, {"answer_start": 403, "text": "60,000 European settlers"}]}, {"id": "5733cf61d058e614000b62ec", "question": "How many people were in British North American Colonies?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 443, "text": "2 million"}, {"answer_start": 443, "text": "2 million"}, {"answer_start": 443, "text": "2 million"}, {"answer_start": 443, "text": "2 million"}, {"answer_start": 443, "text": "2 million"}]}]}]}, {"title": "Force", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines, but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force. In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years. By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia.", "qas": [{"id": "573735e8c3c5551400e51e71", "question": "What concept did philosophers in antiquity use to study simple machines?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 46, "text": "force"}, {"answer_start": 46, "text": "force"}, {"answer_start": 31, "text": "the concept of force"}, {"answer_start": 31, "text": "the concept of force"}, {"answer_start": 46, "text": "force"}, {"answer_start": 46, "text": "force"}]}, {"id": "573735e8c3c5551400e51e72", "question": "What was the belief that maintaining motion required force?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 387, "text": "fundamental error"}, {"answer_start": 385, "text": "A fundamental error"}, {"answer_start": 385, "text": "A fundamental error"}, {"answer_start": 385, "text": "A fundamental error"}, {"answer_start": 385, "text": "A fundamental error"}, {"answer_start": 385, "text": "A fundamental error"}]}, {"id": "573735e8c3c5551400e51e73", "question": "Who had mathmatical insite?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 654, "text": "Sir Isaac Newton"}, {"answer_start": 654, "text": "Sir Isaac Newton"}, {"answer_start": 654, "text": "Sir Isaac Newton"}, {"answer_start": 654, "text": "Sir Isaac Newton"}, {"answer_start": 654, "text": "Sir Isaac Newton"}, {"answer_start": 654, "text": "Sir Isaac Newton"}]}, {"id": "573735e8c3c5551400e51e74", "question": "How long did it take to improve on Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 727, "text": "nearly three hundred years"}, {"answer_start": 727, "text": "nearly three hundred years"}, {"answer_start": 727, "text": "nearly three hundred years"}, {"answer_start": 727, "text": "nearly three hundred years"}, {"answer_start": 727, "text": "nearly three hundred years"}, {"answer_start": 734, "text": "three hundred years"}]}, {"id": "573735e8c3c5551400e51e75", "question": "Who develped the theory of relativity?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 782, "text": "Einstein"}, {"answer_start": 782, "text": "Einstein"}, {"answer_start": 782, "text": "Einstein"}, {"answer_start": 782, "text": "Einstein"}, {"answer_start": 782, "text": "Einstein"}, {"answer_start": 782, "text": "Einstein"}]}]}]}], "version": "1.1"}
